# Task for Fullstack Intership

## Few simple steps

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a simple token listing application
3. Prepare pull request and let us know that you are done

## General guidelines

* Use common sense and don't spend too much time on a single task if you get stuck
* This task might not specify every single detail of how it should be implemented. When in doubt, improvise and go with a solution that you think would work best for a project like this
* Optional tasks are not required for you to complete. But if you're going to do them, start with them as they require some extra initial set up

## Requirements

* Use Laravel
* Use Blade templates
* Use Bootstrap 4

## Functional requirements

* Display a list of tokens
* Ability to add new token
* Ability to update data of an existing token
* Ability to delete an existing token

**Token is a simple model that can have the following fields:**
* id (auto-incrementing integer)
* symbol (e.g. BDG)
* name (e.g. BitDegree)
* homepage (e.g. https://www.bitdegree.org)
* total_supply (e.g. 550000000)
* current_price (e.g. 0.04556)
* timestamps (created_at and updated_at)

## Optional tasks

* Use database migrations
* Use Eloquent models when working with data in the database
* Use CSS preprocessor (SCSS preferred).
* Use a Javascript task runner Webpack
* Create Seeders
* Validate the inputs
* Make your application responsive

## Few tips
- We always prefer the code that is robust, easy to read and re-usable
- Have fun!
